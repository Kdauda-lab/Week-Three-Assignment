# Discount Calculator

This Python script calculates the final price of an item after applying a discount. A discount is only applied if the discount percentage is 20% or higher.

## How It Works
1. The user is prompted to enter the original price of the item.
2. The user enters the discount percentage.
3. If the discount percentage is 20% or more, the script calculates the discounted price.
4. If the discount is less than 20%, the original price remains unchanged.
5. The final price is displayed to the user.

## Usage
Run the script and enter the required values when prompted.

### Example
Enter the original price of the item: 100
Enter the discount percentage: 25
Final price after discount (if applied): 75.00

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
